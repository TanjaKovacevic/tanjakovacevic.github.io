Education
======
* **Ph.D in Earth and Planetary Science**, University of California, Berkeley, 2025 (expected)
* **B.S. in Chemistry**, ACS, University of Colorado, Denver, 2020
* **A.A. Mathematics and Sciences**, Las Posicats Community College 2016

Research experience
======
* **Graduate Student Researcher** - (Fall 2020 - Current)\
U.C. Berkeley - Earth and Planetary Science Department
  * I perform ab initio molecular dynamics in order to calculate equations of sate (EOSs) for material under extreme conditions in order to determine thermodynamic characteristics of  planetary interiors.  
  * Supervisor: Burkhard Militzer

* **Undergraduate Research Assistant** - (Fall 2017 - Spring 2020)\
C.U. Denver - Chemistry Department
  * Conducted a computational study of the villin headpiece subdomain HP-36 computing hypersurface, ring-flipping, profiles of the hydrophobic core (F47 F51, F58) via umbrella sampling. Link to my [poster](../files/HP36.pdf).
  * I wrote a [tutorial](https://github.com/TanjaKovacevic/Umbrella_Sampling/) for Umbrella Sampling/WHAM of a dihedral angle to determine potential of mean force.  
  * Supervisor: Hai Lin
  
* **Undergraduate Research Assitant** - (Summer 2019)\
M.I.T. - Nuclear Science and Engineering Department
  * Performed computational fluid dynamics implementing a novel uncertainty quantification method on GEMIX (international benchmark) bounding experimental results within the turbulent areas of mixing zones. [poster](../files/UQ-Turbulence.pdf) 
  * Supervisor: Emilio Baglietto
